# PriceScale
This is a tool in development to compare grocery store prices.

Currently this tool can compare product prices from [Billa](https://www.billa.at/) and [Penny](https://www.penny.at/). It utilizes the same search mechanic used by these retailers on their sites. At the moment, no further filtering is done when searching for a product, therefore some unexpecting results might be returned.
